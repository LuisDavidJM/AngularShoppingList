## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Angular framework
- Typescript

### What I learned

On this page I learned to do a routing between several screens, I also learned to implement a complete filling form to save new products and finally to make a login to be able to add the products and to be able to eliminate them.

### Continued development

Implement a response design so that the page can be seen on devices with different screens and make use of localStorage to be able to keep the information even if the screen is refreshed.
